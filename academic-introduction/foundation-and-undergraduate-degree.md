# ðŸ“° Foundation and Undergraduate Degree

The main method of learning will be blended learning, where most of the content will be delivered through Blackboard. Although this depends on each school/major, most of the assessments are done open-book and online as well. But, students will still have lectures to review and discuss the content further, and mandatory in-person classes such as tutorials and workshops. The best way to adapt to this kind of blended learning is to make use of both the online & offline material & sessions. Through this [link](https://www.studentsupport.manchester.ac.uk/study-support/) you will be able to access the different services that the University provides to support you in your studies.
