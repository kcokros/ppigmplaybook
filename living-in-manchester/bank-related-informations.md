# ðŸ’· Bank-related Informations

To apply for a bank account, you'll need a bank letter (official document provided by your university confirming your enrollment and local address). It's required by most banks in the UK to open a student bank account.

To collect a bank letter from your Manchester University, follow these steps:

1. Visit the Student Services Centre or the International Office at your university.
2. Request a bank letter. You may need to provide your student ID, passport, and proof of residence.
3. Wait for the letter to be prepared. This may take a few minutes up until days, so plan accordingly.
4. Collect the letter in person.
