### **Finding your General Practitioners?**

&#x20;

Registering with a general practitioner (GP), also referred to as a local practitioner or family doctor in the United Kingdom, is of the utmost importance. This should be completed as soon as your term-time address after your arrival to the UK is determined. General practitioners (GPs) offer various non-emergency services via appointment, such as referrals to other medical specialists, examinations, medication prescriptions, and vaccinations. A list of practices near your address can be located via the NHS Find a GP website. This link will take you to the GPs' websites where you can obtain information on registering as a patient and searching for a GP near you through [https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp)

&#x20;You just need to come to your chosen GP, fill a simple form, and wait for a text message from them

**Pro tip:** try to avoid campus' GPs since their workload is heavier, meaning that you might need to wait longer for services.
