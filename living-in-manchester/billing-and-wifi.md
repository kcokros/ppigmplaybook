#### Gas and Electricity Providers in Manchester

Manchester residents can choose from several gas and electricity providers to find the best deal and service to match their energy needs. Comparing tariffs and understanding the different types of energy plans available is crucial. Here are some of the main energy providers in Manchester:

* [British Gas](https://www.britishgas.co.uk/)
* [E.ON Energy](https://www.eonenergy.com/)
* [npower](https://www.npower.com/)
* [EDF Energy](https://www.edfenergy.com/)
* [Scottish Power](https://www.scottishpower.co.uk/)
* [Octopus Energy](https://octopus.energy/)
* [Rebel Energy](https://www.rebelenergy.com/)

**How to Register or Change Providers**

1. **Compare Prices:** Start by using comparison websites like [Uswitch](https://www.uswitch.com/) or [MoneySuperMarket](https://www.moneysupermarket.com/gas-and-electricity/) to compare prices and find the best deals based on your energy usage.
2. **Choose a Provider:** After comparing rates and services, choose a provider that offers the best deal for your requirements.
3. **Contact the Provider:** Reach out to your chosen provider to initiate the switch. This can typically be done online through their website, or by phone.
4. **Provide Details:** You will need to provide your new provider with details such as your address, meter readings, and potentially some identification.
5. **Switching Process:** The provider will manage the switching process. It can take a few weeks to complete, during which your supply will not be interrupted.

Pro tip #1: Before making a switch, check if there are any termination fees involved with your current contract. If you're moving into a new home, you may be placed on a default 'deemed contract' with the previous occupant's energy supplier. Switching from this can often save you significant money, as these contracts can be more expensive.

Pro tip #2: To potentially save even more, consider looking for dual fuel offers (where the same provider supplies both gas and electricity), or fixed tariff plans that can protect against price increases for the duration of the agreement.

2. **Provide Required Information:** Be prepared to provide your full address, move-in date, and possibly the property's previous occupiers' details.
