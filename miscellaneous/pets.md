#### Steps to Bring a Pet from Indonesia to the UK:

1. **Microchip**: Your pet must be microchipped with a microchip that meets ISO 11784/11785 standards. This should be done before the rabies vaccination.
2. **Rabies Vaccination**: After the microchip is implanted, your pet must be vaccinated against rabies. The vaccination must be done at least 21 days before travel.
3. **Rabies Titer Test**: A blood sample must be taken at least 30 days after the rabies vaccination to test for sufficient antibodies. This sample must be sent to an EU-approved laboratory. The test result must show a rabies antibody level of at least 0.5 IU/ml.
4. **Tapeworm Treatment**: Dogs must be treated for tapeworm (Echinococcus multilocularis) by a vet between 24 and 120 hours before entering the UK. This treatment must be recorded in the pet's passport or health certificate.
5. **Health Certificate**: Obtain an Export Health Certificate (EHC) from a veterinarian in Indonesia. This certificate must confirm that your pet meets all the health requirements to enter the UK.
6. **Approved Transport**: Your pet must travel on an approved route with an approved transport company. Ensure you book your pet‚Äôs transport in advance and confirm the airline's specific requirements for pet travel.
7. **Notify UK Authorities**: Notify the UK‚Äôs Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) at least 48 hours before your pet‚Äôs arrival in the UK. You will also need to fill in a declaration if you are not going to sell or transfer the ownership of your pet.
8. **Customs Clearance**: Upon arrival, your pet will be checked to ensure all documents are in order. Your pet may be quarantined (up to 4 months) if there are any issues.

**Pro Tip #1:** Since Indonesia is not a "Listed Country" according to UK's pet regulations, you must have a pet passport to bring yours to the UK by following [rules from UK's Government](https://www.gov.uk/bring-pet-to-great-britain/pet-passport).

**Pro Tip #2:** Some airlines, such as KLM, charge based on the number of cages, while others, such as Qatar Airways, charge per kilogram of your pet plus the cage. Additionally, some airlines charge a mandatory hotel fee if the transit takes up to a certain number of days. Make sure to do some research.
