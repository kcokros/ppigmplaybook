# ðŸ“— Student Visa

You can apply for a Student visa to study in the UK if youâ€™re 16 or over and you:

* have been offered a place on a course by a licensed student sponsor
* have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course - the amount will vary depending on your circumstances
* can speak, read, write and understand English
* have consent from your parents if youâ€™re 16 or 17 - youâ€™ll need evidence of this when you apply

You can apply for student visa:

* From outside the UK: The earliest you can apply for a visa is 6 months before you start your course. Youâ€™ll usually get a decision on your visa within 3 weeks.
* From inside the UK: The earliest you can apply is 3 months before your course starts. You must apply before your current visa expires. Your new course must begin within 28 days of your current visa expiring. Youâ€™ll usually get a decision within 8 weeks.

### Converting to Student Visa/Graduate Scheme from the UK <a href="#converting-to-student-visa-graduate-scheme-from-the-uk" id="converting-to-student-visa-graduate-scheme-from-the-uk"></a>

If youâ€™re 18 or over and your course is at degree level, you can usually stay in the UK for up to 5 years. If itâ€™s below degree level, you can usually stay in the UK for up to 2 years. You may be able to:

* extend your visa if youâ€™re eligible, for example, to continue your studies in the UK
* switch to a student visa from another visa if youâ€™re already in the UK
* switch to a Graduate visa to stay in the UK for at least 2 years after successfully completing your course.

You can arrive before your course starts. This can be either:

* up to 1 week before, if your course lasts 6 months or less
* up to 1 month before, if your course lasts more than 6 months

You must not travel to the UK before the start date given on your visa, no matter when your course starts.

### Visa and Healthcare Surcharge Fee (2024) <a href="#visa-and-healthcare-surcharge-fee-2022" id="visa-and-healthcare-surcharge-fee-2022"></a>

* The fee for applying for a Student or a Child Student visa from outside the UK is Â£490, to equal the amount charged for in-country applications.

* IHS is now Â£1,035 for each year of the visa for adults, and Â£776 for students and individuals under 18.

You must pay the visa fee for each person that joins you.

When you apply for your student visa you must provide:

* a current passport or other valid travel documentation
* a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) from your course provider

You may also need to provide:

* proof you have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course - this will vary depending on your circumstances

* proof of your relationship to your parent or guardian if you're under 18

If youâ€™re under 18 youâ€™ll need written consent from both parents or legal guardians (or one parent if they have sole responsibility). This must include their consent for:

* your living and care arrangements in the UK

Youâ€™ll also need to provide a copy of your birth certificate (or another government-issued document) that shows the names of your parents.
