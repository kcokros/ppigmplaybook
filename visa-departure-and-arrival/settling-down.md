Pro Tip: If you are **NOT** planning to watch entertainment such as:

* All TV channels, like BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Dave and international channels
* Pay TV services, like Sky, Virgin Media and BT
* Live TV on streaming services, like YouTube and Amazon Prime Video
* Everything on BBC iPlayer.

it's essential to formally declare that you do not require a TV license. While it's not mandatory, it can help prevent misunderstandings or unnecessary contact from the TV Licensing Authority, who might otherwise assume you need one and will pay you a visit.
